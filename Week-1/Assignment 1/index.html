  <!-- First stanza -->
  <p>I'm Nobody! Who are you? <br><br>
    Are you - Nobody - Too? <br><br>
    Then there's a pair of us! <br><br>
    Don't tell! They'd banish us - you know!

    <!-- Second Stanza -->
  </p> 
    How dreary - to be - Somebody! <br><br>
    How public - like a Frog - <br><br>
    To tell one's name - the livelong June - To an admiring Bog!</p>
  <p>

    By Emily Dickinson (1891)
