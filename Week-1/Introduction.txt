Scaling - 
Whenever resources for web application becomes short due to high demand, the web application can crash. So to avoid that we can increase its performance by adding additional resources for the same servers like increasing more ram. This is vertical scaling.
In another type of scaling, we can increase the number of servers rather than increase the resources of the same server. This is known as horizontal scaling. It is more effective as there are no limits on the number of servers we can attach. Also when there is no need. We can reduce the number for cost savings.

What is SEO -
It is the technique to make our web application such that it follows rules for search engines so that our web application can be rank in a better position and it is easily available for search engines so whenever a query related to our web application is searched, the search engine can show users about our web application
